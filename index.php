	<p>Assets management plays a vital role in the prosperity of any firm.<br>
	This system ensures that all systems inputed into the system can be <br>
	monitored and everytime an activity is performed on the asset,<br>
	the technician records into the system which remains as a proof of activity.</p>
	<p>This system is handy in that you can know the assets in a certain department<br> 
	and plan an upgrade without going to their location physically. </p><br>
